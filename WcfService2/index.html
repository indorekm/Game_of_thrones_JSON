                    <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong>is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter <em>George R. R. Martin</em>.
                    He began the first volume of the series, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy,
                    has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series published in 2011, A Dance with Dragons,
                    took Martin six years to write. He is currently writing the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter.

                    Set on the fictional continents of <em>Westeros</em> and <em>Essos</em>, Game of Thrones has several plot lines and a large ensemble cast but centers
                    on three primary story arcs. The first story arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and
                    conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne.
                    The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting a return to the throne.
                    The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples
                    and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.
